# Sound Stream Ripper

## About The Project

**Sound Stream Ripper** is a Python command-line interface (CLI) program designed to download songs or entire playlists from Spotify and convert them to MP3 format. It finds the YouTube URL of the music and uses the [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) library to download the video. After that, it converts the video to MP3 and adds various metadata to the downloaded audio file, such as album art, album name, artists, and release date, using the [mutagen](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen) library. This program also interacts with the Spotify API through the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.21.0/) library.
